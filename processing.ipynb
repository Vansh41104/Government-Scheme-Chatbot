The TEPs are conducted in a thematic manner where all proposals of a particular theme are \\nevaluated together by a common committee. All proposals are scored by individual TEP Experts an d \\nthe Geometric Mean of Individual Scores is used to arrive at the final score for a particular proposal.  \\n• Proposals  with score  ≥60 are considered  at the next step (ESC)  \\n• Proposals  with score  <60 are not considered  further  \\nStep 05:  Scoring Cut -off decision by the Expert Selection Committee (ESC): ESC takes the final \\ndecision with regard to the cut -off score for final selection.
